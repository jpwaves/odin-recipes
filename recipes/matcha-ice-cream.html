        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe details instructions on how to make matcha ice cream. Although an ice cream maker machine is helpful for this recipe, it is not required. The basic components are matcha powder, sugar, salt, and cream (this particular ingredient can be substituted with several different types of creams, but generally you need some sort of dairy product with a high fat content). If you are a matcha and dessert lover, this recipe is definitely for you!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 tbsp matcha</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp kosher/sea salt</li>
            <li>3 cups half and half (or 2 1/4 cups whole milk and 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream, or 1 cup 2% reduced-fat milk and 2 cup heavy whipping cream, or 1 1/2 cup whole milk and 1 1/2 cup light cream)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><em>Only for those using an ice cream maker machine: Freeze your mixing bowl 24 hours before cooking.</em></li>
            <li>Measure out all ingredients.</li>
            <li>In medium saucepan, combine your milk and cream (or half and half) and turn heat to medium-low.</li>
            <li>Add sugar amd salt and whisk together until sugar is dissolved. Once sugar is dissolved, turn off the heat. <strong>Remove pot from heat if small bubbles form around the edges of the pot and NEVER let it boil.</strong></li>
            <li>Add 3 Tbsp of milk mixture to matcha powder and mix until liquid absorbs matcha. Repeat this until the matcha liquid is a thick liquid.</li>
            <li>Transfer the matcha liquid to the milk mixture and mix until thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Pour matcha mixture through a sieve into your cold bowl and press out all the caught clumps.</li>
            <li>Let your mixture cool on counter top. Once cool, cover with plastic wrap and let it chill in the refridgerator for <strong>at least 4 hours.</strong></li>
            <li>If you are using an ice cream maker machine, put the matcha mixture into the machine and follow the machine's instructions.
