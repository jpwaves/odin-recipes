        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe details instructions on how to make matcha ice cream. Although an ice cream maker machine is helpful for this recipe, it is not required. The basic components are matcha powder, sugar, salt, and cream (this particular ingredient can be substituted with several different types of creams, but generally you need some sort of dairy product with a high fat content). If you are a matcha and dessert lover, this recipe is definitely for you!</p>
