        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>One of Japan's classic comfort foods, Gyudon (牛丼) is a quick, nutritious, and satisfying meal. At its core, it is a bowl of rice served with thin slices of meat, onion, and egg on top and is finished with a sweet and savory sauce. This dish is part of a category of <em>donburi</em> dishes, with other variations having different types of meat on top instead of beef. Additionally, this dish is sometimes served with a raw egg yolk or soft poached egg (Onsen Tamago) on top of the sliced beef and onions and egg already on top of the bed of rice (for consumption in the US, onsen tamago is the safest option due to the quality of US eggs).</p>
